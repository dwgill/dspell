dspell
======

dspell is a rudimentary spell checker written as an educational exercise
in natural language processing. It can be run by executing any ofthe 
following from the dspell/ directory:

    ./sp_correct.py str "your string to correct"
    ./sp_correct.py file /path/to/your/file
    ./sp_correct.py dir /path/to/your/dir

Due to the slow speed of the algorithm, running dspell on data of size
beyond single sentences is not recommended.
